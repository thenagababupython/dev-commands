OS:Operating system is an interface between user and the computer hardware.
~The hardware of computer can not understand human languge whereas humans can not understand these binary languges in o and 1 s,in such case we need an interface which can translate human language to hardawre and vice-versa for effective communication.
~Types of OS:-
 1.single user single tasking os:-one user and one task at a time. Ex: MS-DOS
 2.single user multi tasking os:-one user with multi task. Ex:Windows98
 3.multi user multi tasking os:-multi user with multi tasking Ex:UNIX,linux

Architecture of Unix:-
The architecture of unix can be divided into three levels of functionality.
-The lowest level is the kernel, which schedules tasks,manages resources, and controls security.
-The next level is the shell,which acts as user interface,interpreting user commands and starting applications.
-The highest level is utilities,which provides utility functions,in other words it is user level,as user is the one who aperates those utilities.

File system hierarchy:-
-------------------------------
- Linux uses single rooted, inverted tree like file system hierarchy

/:-  It is parent directory for all other directories .It is called as ROOT directory
     => C:\ of windows
/root:- It is the home directory for root user(super user)
           =>/root is similar to c:\documents & settings\administrator
/home:- It is home directory for other users
             =>/home is similar to c:\documents & settings\username
/boot:- It contains bootable files for linux
/etc:- It contains all configuration files like /etc/passwd-user info, /etc/group-groups info
          => /etc is similar to c:\windows\system32\drivers\
/usr:- By default softwares are installed in /usr directory
         =>/usr is similar to C:\program files
/opt:- It is optional directory for /usr. It contains third party softwares.
         =>/opt is similar to c:\Program files
/bin:- It contains commands used by all users(Binary files)
/sbin:- It contains commands used by only super user(root)(super user's binary files)
/dev:- It conatins device files, like /dev/had-for hard drives, /dev/cd rom- for cd drives
          =>/dev similar to device manager of windows
/proc:- It contain process files, the contents are not permanent,it is called virtual directory
/mnt:- It is default mount point for any partition.It is empty by default
/media:- It contains all of removable media like CD-ROM,pen drive
/lib:- It contains library files which are used by OS
        => /lib is similar to .dll files of windows
